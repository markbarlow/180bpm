                <p>Search your local app store for a range of metronome apps, many of them free. I found <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/metronome/id416443133?mt=8">MetroTimer</a> does the job for an iPhone. Or if excessive skeuomorphism is your thing then yes, inevitably there are several <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/real-metronome-free-precise/id559798172?mt=8">apps which look like a real metronome</a>. Using a metronome was particularly good when first retraining myself to use shorter, faster strides. But after a while it does get a bit boring hence, well, everything else on this web site.</p>

                <p>The Most Mathematically Perfect Playlist for Running (Updated) http://gizmodo.com/5906815/the-most-mathematically-perfect-playlist-for-running
                <p>Spotify Running https://www.spotify.com/uk/running/ and  http://www.ibtimes.com/spotify-running-update-runners-all-levels-explain-music-apps-new-feature-1965679
                Integrates with Runkeeper, which is a handy feature.
                Note this requires an internet connection, so will help drain your battery on a longer run.
                Its primarily designed to analyse your pace and find music to match
                ITs likely to give you songs you want to skip, meaning you need easy access to your phone (wired review)
                It's available to both free and premium Spotify members, though with a free account, you'll hear ads between songs and there's a limit on how many tracks you can skip while running (cnet review).
                How to https://support.spotify.com/uk/using_spotify/lifestyle_features/running/

                How it works http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/how-does-spotify-running-work#0sYVSruqqRQhAOcm.99
                "The first thing you'll need to do is work out your running tempo. In the Start Running mode, the app will prompt you to run at a steady pace. It'll then use the accelerometer built into your phone to track the motion. The running tempo is then turned into beats per minute, which then helps build playlists based on that data.

                Tracks used are taken out of Spotify's existing catalogue and is a mixture of human and computer curation. To make sure you don't end up with a playlist full of music you hate running to, it'll base selections on previous listening history."


                Wired review - http://www.wired.co.uk/article/spotify-running-review
                CNET review - https://www.cnet.com/uk/news/hitting-the-pavement-with-spotify-running-hands-on/
                "You cannot pick just any track, album or playlist to listen to with Spotify Running. Instead, You get two pools of music to pick from; "Running Originals" and "Running Playlists." The Originals are new, original instrumental tracks created by Spotify for different running moods, including a beat-heavy pick made by dance music DJ Tiesto. Each has several chapters that are a few minutes long. I didn't really care for these tracks, but if you like background music, they could be great for you. The Running Playlists is where you'll find playlists that Spotify thinks you'll like, based on your listening history. Each playlist is focused on a genre -- pop, rock, country, hip-hop, etc. -- and uses popular and classic songs to make up the playlist. You cannot see the tracks in those playlists, since they change each time you go running."
                <blockquote>Another high point is that Spotify tries to only play the high-energy parts of each song and then fades to another track when the song's music starts to slow or quiet down. This eliminates those slow beginnings and endings that I might get with a full song that drag me down when I'm trying to power through the last half mile. The app also uses that fade if you change tracks, so there's never an abrupt stop to trip you up.</blockquote>

                So - ok for random and no effort; some unwelcome tracks and timings not spot-on.




                <h2 class="section-heading">Specialist running music apps</h2>
                <p> <a href="http://www.rockmyrun.com">Rock My Run</a> - basic app is free, lots of variable bpm stations in ranges e.g. 140-149bpm or 160+bpm, but you can't set the bpm/spm without upgrading to a subscription.


<!--
                Also can be set to adjust to match your body movement, though that's somewhat against the point)

 $4.99/month, $12.99/quarter or $35.99/year. All memberships automatically renew unless otherwise cancelled.

Range of rock, hip hop, house etc

Balance of both mainstream and under-the-radar songs
DJ remixes of songs that you can’t hear anywhere else
Increasing intensity &amp; energy of songs or the lyrics in the songs as a mix progresses to help keep your energy up as you fatigue
A new song every two minutes or so: Long enough to hear enough of a song that you like, short enough that if you don’t like the song it will be over soon :)
Interesting effects included in mixes like scratching, flange, echo’s, high-pass filters etc.
Frequent “build ups” (portions of the mix where the beat doubles up, then doubles up again and again and again)
Infrequent major “breakdowns” (portions of the mix without music or beat)

                <h2 class="section-heading">Analyse your own music library</h2>
                <p>Add in the software used at home to check existing music - Abyssmedia's <a href="http://www.abyssmedia.com/bpmcounter/">BPM Counter</a>. If you have your library on your PC then this does the job.

                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/bpm-counter.png" alt="BPM Counter app">

                </p>

                <p>Also https://songbpm.com/ but can't vouch for that (compare a few) - it can return the <A href="https://songbpm.com/winged-victory-for-the-sullen/steep-hills-of-vicodin-tears">same song three times with different answers</a> and varies widely from the BPM counter results. Its also not guaranteed to find the song you're after, whereas BPM Counter you can point at anything on your desktop. It uses the <A href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-track/ ">Spotify API</a> for the song data but it's not clear who/where the bpm calculation comes from.</p>


                <h2 class="section-heading">DJ apps which also do the job</h2>
