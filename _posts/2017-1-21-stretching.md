<p>A few years ago, my dentist told me I should start flossing. I gave it a brief go, but found it a bit of a hassle and made brushing the teeth take longer, so didn't stick with it. I was reminded a few times over the next few visits, and ignored those reminders. Until, that is, I needed root canal treatment. Since then I've flossed regularly.</p>

<p>My experience with stretching is similar. I took the view that the first 5 minutes of a run was for stretching, and afterwards there was never time for much more than a cursory stretch left and right before getting showered and changed. I kept coming across articles recommending stretching, and kept ignoring them. Until, that is, I hurt my hamstring.</p>

<p>I went to see a physio, who got me going on some exercises and recommended using a foam roller. Youtube is also full of helpful videos showing stretches that will help your hamstring recover. As it was a recurring problem, I've carried some of these through into every run now. I don't go to town with it, but a little before and a little after seems to have helped keep the problem at bay. </p>

<p>The key, I'm told, is to make sure you hold the positions for a good while. And also, take it easy beforehand -  a rapid fire succession of to-the-limit stretches could be detrimental, and may cause exactly what you're trying to avoid.</p>

<p>As for the foam roller? Well, it gets the odd look in, but not often. It's more commonly used as a 'robotic arm' by the kids.</p>
