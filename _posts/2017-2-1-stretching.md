<p>A few years ago, my dentist told me I should start flossing. I gave it a brief go, but found it a hassle and it made brushing the teeth take longer, so I didn't stick with it. I was reminded several times over the next few visits to the dentist, and ignored those reminders. Until, that is, I needed root canal treatment. Since then I've flossed regularly.</p>

<p>My experience with stretching is similar. I initially took the view that the first 5 minutes of a run was for stretching, and afterwards there was never time for much more than a cursory stretch left and right before getting showered and changed. I kept coming across articles recommending stretching, and kept ignoring them. Until, that is, I strained my hamstring.</p>

<p>I went to see a physio, who got me going on some exercises and recommended using a foam roller. Youtube is also full of videos showing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG_SZ6o2hD0">hamstring stretches</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGIBHcREljk">massages</a> that will help you recover. As it was a recurring problem, I've carried some of these through into every run now. I don't go to town with it, but a little before and a little after seems to have helped keep the problem at bay. </p>

<p>The key, I'm told, is to make sure you hold the positions for a good while. And also, take it easy beforehand -  a rapid fire succession of to-the-limit stretches could be detrimental, and may cause exactly what you're trying to avoid.</p>

<p>As for the foam roller? Well, it gets the odd look in, but not often. It's more commonly used as a 'robotic arm'.</p>
