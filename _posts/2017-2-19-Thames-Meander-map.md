Here's a map with the routes for the <a href="http://www.hermesrunning.com/thames-meander/">Thames Meander marathon and half marathon</a>, with the aid stations and other points of interest marked on it. I put this together by downloading the <a href="https://www.eventrac.co.uk/race-course-map/thames-meander-marathon-04-11-2017-10-00#anchor">eventrac official course route information</a>, uploading it to Google's My Maps, then adding in the other information kindly provided by the event race director David Ross at Hermes Running.

Marathon Route:
<blockquote>The course meanders along the Thames Path out to the far side of Canbury Gardens and then returns past the HQ and along the Thames Path trail as far as the Barn Elms Rowing Club turnaround point, returning past the HQ again to the far side of Canbury Gardens which is the ﬁnal turnaround point, returning to ﬁnish at the YMCA HQ.<br> - <a href="http://www.hermesrunning.com/thames-meander/">Hermes Running</a></blockquote>


Half Marathon Route:
<blockquote>The course starts in the opposite direction to the marathon and meanders along the Thames Path out to the ﬁrst turnaround point at the Kew Gardens car park, then returning past the race HQ and on towards Canbury Gardens just past the Boaters Inn Pub which is the ﬁnal half marathon turnaround point, returning to ﬁnish at the YMCA HQ.<br> - <a href="http://www.hermesrunning.com/thames-meander/">Hermes Running</a></blockquote>

<p>The map above has approximate markers for the various aid stations:</p>

* Aid Station 1 YMCA HQ start / finish
* Aid Station 2 Petersham fields, about 6 miles in
* Aid Station 3 Kew Gardens car park (half marathon turnaround), about 9.5 miles in 
* Aid Station 4 Barnes Bridge (marathon runners only), about 11.5 miles in
* Aid Station 5 Barn Elms Boat Club (marathon turnaround point), about 13 miles in
