<p>Preparing for a marathon is a risky affair. You invest so much time in the training, and it all has to come together on one particular morning. If you're carrying a hamstring strain, feeling under the weather or having a busy period at work - too bad. I've been lucky not to have anything major get in the way, but <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-3-31-a-tale-of-two-marathons %}">both times I've run a marathon</a> to date I had some problems that last week.</p>

<p>So what to do about this risk? Can you hedge it? Can you get a two-for-one deal on the training? That was what I was thinking this time around, as I embarked on my second marathon training. I wondered whether I should think in terms of two marathons in short succession, and did some research to find out whether that's sensible or not.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/ask-coach-jenny/racing-multiple-marathons-everything-you-need-to-know">Runners world</a> to <a href="http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/back-to-back-marathons">Women's health</a> and <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/plan-carefully-for-back-to-back-marathons">back</a> I found many articles, with a wide range of conflicting advice. In the end I concluded you can find an opinion to suit your own needs. There are people advising against it, those saying it's ok (with some notes of warning), then the extremes of <a href="http://www.sportrelief.com/whats-going-on/eddie-izzard-marathon-man">Eddie Izzard</a> and the <a href="http://www.the401challenge.co.uk/">401 challenge</a>. The latter may be outliers with support crews and so on, but it still does make you wonder: why not have a go?</p>

<p>Then there are the numbers, which are persuasive. Say you run 3-4 times a week during a 16 week marathon training period, that's 56 runs for one marathon, or a ratio of 56:1. Then say you manage another 16 runs for a second crack 5 or 6 weeks later, that's a total of 72 runs for 2 marathons or a ratio of 36:1. At face value that sounds a lot better doesn't it?</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Tips for running two marathons in short succession</h2>

<p>So, having read around and considered the options, here's a distillation of all the advice if you do decide to give it a try:</p>


 * Rest the first week after marathon #1 - this is not a hard one to follow!
 * After that rest, look at how many weeks you have to go to #2, and - bearing in mind the points below - loosely follow your plan for the equivalent final weeks before marathon #1
 * If marathon #2 is 4-5 weeks after the first, then count your first marathon as the last long training run
 * When you get started running again after the rest, you can stick to easy paced running: you're "maintaining not training", so there's no need to push it
 * However, if you've done easy running for a couple of weeks and feel recovered, and you're not yet onto the taper of your plan, then prioritise intensity over distance - intervals, <a href="https://runnersconnect.net/training-with-thresholds-in-the-right-zone/">lactate threshold tempo runs</a>, etc
 * Listen to your body not your mind - rest and recovery trumps running
 * When the mind pushes you to do more, or up the pace, remind yourself it's not a traditional training plan you're following
 * There isn't a sweet spot which combines 100% recovery with 100% of the endurance levels from your original training - you're going to lose out on one or the other
 * If you're doing #2 just a few weeks after your first, be prepared to consider it as a run-for-fun rather than an opportunity for a PB
 * If you're hoping to do #2 at full pelt then you're likely to need at least 8 to 12 weeks between the marathons (6 if you're really fit) - at which point given those extra weeks' work it may well feel much less like a two-for-one deal on your marathon training
 * Do one 16 to 20 mile run if you're up to it, but don't force it
 * A bit of foam rolling or a massage won't go amiss
 * Eat well, sleep well
 * Go with what the day brings and don't forget to enjoy the experience

<h2 class="section-heading">Choosing the second marathon</h2>

<p>Then there are the logistics to consider. Given the risk that circumstances may intervene, for #2 I recommend looking for the following:</p>

 * Refunds in the case of an injury preventing you running
 * If there are no refunds, then find a marathon which doesn't sell out early and which leaves registration open right up until the last minute - so you don't have to book until you're pretty confident you can do it
 * A marathon that sends the race packs out by post or allows pickup on the day. This saves you having to arrive a day early (often by midday, the way some of them are organised) - important if you want to minimise time away or impact on family
 * A marathon that's reasonably nearby, and accessible by train or bus so you don't have to drive afterwards. Who knows what you'll feel like?

<h2 class="section-heading">Putting it into practise</h2>

<p>For me, the marathon #2 candidate which met these requirements turned out to be the <a href="https://www.bostonmarathon.co.uk/">Boston marathon UK</a>, also known as the Boston (not that one) marathon. It falls 5 weeks after the <a href="http://www.hermesrunning.com/thames-meander/">Thames Meander</a> I did as marathon #1. And groin strain permitting, it's now 4 days away. When I started running <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-1-28-180-steps-intro %}">I put the 180 steps per minute theory to the test</a>; so now it's time to test this one - let's see how it works out.</p>
