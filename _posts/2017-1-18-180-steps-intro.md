# For intro post on 180 experience from presentation

Intro

I’d like to talk to you about running, specifically running cadence or steps per minute
Put your hand up if you do any running?
Put your hand up if you do any cycling, swimming or some other exercise?


*My running start & the concept*

So I started running in January 2015
Like many middle aged people, I wanted to get some exercise and fool myself that I was clinging on to the last vestiges of youthful vigour.
I soon got into it, and after a few months of running I came across this concept that 180 steps per minute is the optimal running rhythm
This originates in studies of the 1984 Olympics that found that all the most successful middle and long distance runners ran at around 180 steps per minute
It has since trickled down to all levels as a goal to aim for to help you

This is what 180 steps per minute is like (metronome)

*Testing the theory*

So I thought I’d test the theory myself
Using a running app, I found my previous runs were around 140 spm, and with the help of a metronome I started trying to increase them to 180…..it felt very weird
Baby steps + roadrunner cartoon
Let me demonstrate, concentrate on my legs here….
140 is like this:
180 is like this:
Less extension, less height, less impact

Benefits:
1.  Not as tired or achey
2.  Helped me go further
3.  Helped me go faster
4.  Easier to change direction and avoid puddles - or tourists randomly stepping out in front of you *without looking*

Needless to say, I heartily recommend it

*Take away*

So what I’d like you to do in the next few week is the following:
If you’re a runner, try 180 steps per minute, or failing that just try increasing cadence by 10% - it will help



And more on the theme:

THIS FOR BLOG:
Personally I tried increasing from 140 to 180. It felt strange at first but soon became a comfortable rhythm which not only felt faster but did help me actually go faster over longer distances without feeling as tired as with the longer strides from before. With shorter steps your legs gain less height - and therefore make less impact when hitting the ground - and legs and feet are not so extended when you hit the ground.
And the added bonus, with smaller strides it's easier to switch direction when someone randomly steps in front of you without looking.

The knees take less impact, and with smaller strides it's easier to switch direction when someone steps in front of you without looking.

“Fitter people have a little longer stride, but the rate stays the same,” said Jack Daniels, coach, exercise physiologist and author of the seminal book Daniels’ Running Formula, which first included analysis of stride rate.

Daniels’ initial study that established the magic number of 180 steps per minute was conducted during the 1984 Olympics. He counted the stride rates of every athlete competing in every distance from 800 meters on up. Only one racer had a stride rate below 180 steps per minute – and she was at 176. Conversely, over his years as a coach and collegiate physical education instructor, he never had a student above 180 steps. The average recreational runner is closer to 150-170 steps per minute.

That original research has since been duplicated and corroborated many times. In a race in London in 2011, Bernard Lagat outkicked Kenenisa Bekele with a 51 second last lap, but his cadence stayed just over 200 steps per minute throughout the entire race, not increasing as he sprinted for the finish. In the 2011 Boston Marathon, both Desiree Davila and Caroline Kilel held a 180-190 stride rate even as they struggle at the end of the race. Over and over, top runners maintain consistently high stride rates."

http://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/increase-your-stride-rate - "Researchers have determined that most elite distance runners have a stride rate of about 180 strides per minute."

At the 1984 Olympics, Coach Jack Daniels conducted research by counting the SPM of accomplished distance runners. Daniels found the fastest, most efficient runners achieved at least 180 SPM. After Daniels shared his observation, the running world exploded with the new-found knowledge and many coaches pushed athletes of all abilities to run 180 SPM or faster.
More recently, scientists in the field of biomechanics agree that running with a faster cadence (or high SPM) can increase speed, though the golden rule of 180 SPM does not apply across the board. Instead, experts recommend runners measure their cadence and set a goal to increase the SPM by 5 â€“ 10%. A 5 â€“ 10% growth may not result in a 180 SPM number; however a runner will still experience performance enhancement and reduce the risk of injury by improving her cadence.
