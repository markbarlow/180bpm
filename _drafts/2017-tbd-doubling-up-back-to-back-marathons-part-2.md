part 1 / part 2

<p>Having put together a summary of all the advice on running back-to-back marathons, it was time to walk the walk.</p>

<p>After the <a href="http://www.hermesrunning.com/thames-meander/">Thames Meander</a> in March, I had 5 weeks until my next marathon in <a href="https://www.bostonmarathon.co.uk/">Boston, UK</a>.


I started with a week off from running, just slipping a swim in to loosen the limbs
I did 5-10 minutes of foam rolling 3 times that week - calves, quads, ITB, hamstrings
Number of runs / distance between plus the two long ones in there:
17 runs totalling 122 miles
The big ones were one 17 mile run, one 14 mile run and one 12 mile run
One swim
One hour of 5-a-side football
I did try consciously not to overdo it


The rhythm of it - rest, heavy legs and slow right up to week before, swim and run, foam rolling, good last week.. Groin question all the way and into the race at half way, half expecting it to flare at any point but held out


<h2 class="section-heading">How did it feel?</h2>




<h2 class="section-heading">Race day</h2>


PB after all, and sensible run

Biggest problem was GPS watch no signal, so reverted to using my phone. Spent about 20 minutes trying different spots to no avail, the only advantage being it distracted me from the pre-race nerves.







Felt a lot better after than from the previous one, though that in part because messed that up somewhat. And in the following days too, felt much fresher.



<h2 class="section-heading">Original - Tips for running two marathons in short succession</h2>

<p>So, having read around and considered the options, here's a distillation of all the advice if you do decide to give it a try:</p>


 * Rest the first week after marathon #1 - this is not a hard one to follow!
 * After that rest, look at how many weeks you have to go to #2, and - bearing in mind the points below - loosely follow your plan for the equivalent final weeks before marathon #1
 * If marathon #2 is 4-5 weeks after the first, then count your first marathon as the last long training run
 * When you get started running again after the rest, you can stick to easy paced running: you're "maintaining not training", so there's no need to push it
 * However, if you've done easy running for a couple of weeks and feel recovered, and you're not yet onto the taper of your plan, then prioritise intensity over distance - intervals, <a href="https://runnersconnect.net/training-with-thresholds-in-the-right-zone/">lactate threshold tempo runs</a>, etc
 * Listen to your body not your mind - rest and recovery trumps running
 * When the mind pushes you to do more, or up the pace, remind yourself it's not a traditional training plan you're following
 * There isn't a sweet spot which combines 100% recovery with 100% of the endurance levels from your original training - you're going to lose out on one or the other
 * If you're doing #2 just a few weeks after your first, be prepared to consider it as a run-for-fun rather than an opportunity for a PB
 * If you're hoping to do #2 at full pelt then you're likely to need at least 8 to 12 weeks between the marathons (6 if you're really fit) - at which point given those extra weeks' work it may well feel much less like a two-for-one deal on your marathon training
 * Do one 16 to 20 mile run if you're up to it, but don't force it
 * A bit of foam rolling or a massage won't go amiss
 * Eat well, sleep well
 * Go with what the day brings and don't forget to enjoy the experience

<p>For me, the marathon #2 candidate which met these requirements turned out to be the <a href="https://www.bostonmarathon.co.uk/">Boston marathon UK</a>, also known as the Boston (not that one) marathon. It falls 5 weeks after the <a href="http://www.hermesrunning.com/thames-meander/">Thames Meander</a> I did as marathon #1. And groin strain permitting, it's now 4 days away. When I started running <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-1-28-180-steps-intro %}">I put the 180 steps per minute theory to the test</a>; so now it's time to test this one - let's see how it works out.
