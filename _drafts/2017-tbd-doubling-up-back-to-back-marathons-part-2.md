part 1 / part 2

<p></p>

<p>After the <a href="http://www.hermesrunning.com/thames-meander/">Thames Meander</a> in March, I had 5 weeks until my next marathon in <a href="https://www.bostonmarathon.co.uk/">Boston, UK</a>. After talking the talk with <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-4-13-doubling-up-back-to-back-marathons %}">a summary of all the advice on running two marathons in close proximity</a>, it was time to walk the walk.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What did I do?</h2>

<p>So, practising what I'd preached, in those 5 weeks I did the following:</p>

 * I started with a week off from running, just slipping one swim in to loosen the limbs
 * I did 5-10 minutes of foam rolling 3 times that first week - calves, quads, ITB, hamstrings
 * I also looked up exercises for a groin strain and did them for the first time. I'd done something to my left groin trying to get up from a prone state after my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-3-31-a-tale-of-two-marathons %}">difficulties at the Thames meander</a>
 * In all I completed 17 runs totalling 122 miles
 * The big ones were one 17 mile run, one 14 mile run and one 12 mile run
 * I also did one hour of 5-a-side football, which was good for a change of scene but bad for the groin - the lateral and stop/start movements did me no favours, so I retired to a place in goal 
 * Using the "maintaining not training" motto I tried not to overdo the amount or distance, not to attempt to go too quickly, and not to feel bad if I missed a planned run 


<h2 class="section-heading">How did it feel?</h2>

<p>For the first 4 weeks I definitely felt I still needed rest and recovery. I could feel speed and ease slowly returning in the legs, but they still felt heavy and slow right up to a week before. So the knowledge that I didn't need to push it really helped for that month, relieving the mental pressure and allowing me the time and mental space to recover. I think this was crucial. In the final week I felt my legs coming good and a freshness returning just in time.</p>

<p>Aside from the general recovery, the other issue was my groin strain. The pain was diminishing, but only very gradually and I couldn't shake it off.  Once I got warmed up it was ok, especially on the flat with predictable leg movements, but I still winced when stretching or getting out of bed without care, and never quite knew if a setback was round the corner. I didn't finalise travel until 2 weeks before as I wasn't confident I was in the clear.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Race day</h2>

<p>Come race day, my biggest problem pre-race was my GPS watch failing to get a location fix, so I reverted last minute to using my phone instead. I spent about 20 minutes trying different spots to no avail, and to huge frustration - the only advantage being it distracted me from the usual pre-race nerves.</p>

<p>The groin niggle was in the back of my mind and I started to feel it more at about half way, fearing it could flare up at any point but my luck was in - it held out and I forgot about it entirely for the last 7 or 8 miles. And with much more steady, controlled running than last time I both enjoyed it more as it was going on, and finished with a PB after all despite the expectation setting.</p>





Felt a lot better after than from the previous one, though that in part because messed that up somewhat. And in the following days too, felt much fresher.



<h2 class="section-heading">Original - Tips for running two marathons in short succession</h2>

<p>So, having read around and considered the options, here's a distillation of all the advice if you do decide to give it a try:</p>


 * Rest the first week after marathon #1 - this is not a hard one to follow!
 * After that rest, look at how many weeks you have to go to #2, and - bearing in mind the points below - loosely follow your plan for the equivalent final weeks before marathon #1
 * If marathon #2 is 4-5 weeks after the first, then count your first marathon as the last long training run
 * When you get started running again after the rest, you can stick to easy paced running: you're "maintaining not training", so there's no need to push it
 * However, if you've done easy running for a couple of weeks and feel recovered, and you're not yet onto the taper of your plan, then prioritise intensity over distance - intervals, <a href="https://runnersconnect.net/training-with-thresholds-in-the-right-zone/">lactate threshold tempo runs</a>, etc
 * Listen to your body not your mind - rest and recovery trumps running
 * When the mind pushes you to do more, or up the pace, remind yourself it's not a traditional training plan you're following
 * There isn't a sweet spot which combines 100% recovery with 100% of the endurance levels from your original training - you're going to lose out on one or the other
 * If you're doing #2 just a few weeks after your first, be prepared to consider it as a run-for-fun rather than an opportunity for a PB
 * If you're hoping to do #2 at full pelt then you're likely to need at least 8 to 12 weeks between the marathons (6 if you're really fit) - at which point given those extra weeks' work it may well feel much less like a two-for-one deal on your marathon training
 * Do one 16 to 20 mile run if you're up to it, but don't force it
 * A bit of foam rolling or a massage won't go amiss
 * Eat well, sleep well
 * Go with what the day brings and don't forget to enjoy the experience

<p>For me, the marathon #2 candidate which met these requirements turned out to be the <a href="https://www.bostonmarathon.co.uk/">Boston marathon UK</a>, also known as the Boston (not that one) marathon. It falls 5 weeks after the <a href="http://www.hermesrunning.com/thames-meander/">Thames Meander</a> I did as marathon #1. And groin strain permitting, it's now 4 days away. When I started running <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-1-28-180-steps-intro %}">I put the 180 steps per minute theory to the test</a>; so now it's time to test this one - let's see how it works out.
