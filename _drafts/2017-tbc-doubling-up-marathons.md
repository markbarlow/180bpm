<p>Preparing for a marathon is a risky affair. You invest so much time in the training, and it all has to come together in one particular morning. If you're carrying a hamstring strain, feeling under the weather, having a busy period at work, being kept awake at night - too bad. I've been lucky not to have anything major get in the way, but <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-3-31-a-tale-of-two-marathons %}">both times I've run a marathon</a> I had some problems that last week.</p>

<p>So what to do about this risk? Can you hedge it? Can you get a two-for-one deal on the training? That was what I was thinking this time around as I embarked on my second marathon training. I wondered whether I should think in terms of two marathons in short succession, and began reading around to find out whether that's sensible or not.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/ask-coach-jenny/racing-multiple-marathons-everything-you-need-to-know">Runners world</a> to <a href="http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/back-to-back-marathons">Women's health</a> and <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/plan-carefully-for-back-to-back-marathons">back</a> I found many articles, with a whole load of conflicting advice, and in the end concluded you can find an opinion to suit your own needs. There are people advising against it, those saying it's ok with some notes of warning, then the extremes of <a href="http://www.sportrelief.com/whats-going-on/eddie-izzard-marathon-man">Eddie Izzard</a> and the <a href="http://www.the401challenge.co.uk/">401 challenge</a>. The latter may be outliers with support crews and so on, but it still does make you wonder: why not have a go?</p>

<p>Then there's the numbers which get persuasive. Say you run 3-4 times a week during a 16 week marathon training period, that's 56 runs for one marathon, or a ratio of 56:1. Then say you manage another 16 runs for a second crack 5 or 6 weeks later, that's a total of 72 runs for 2 marathons or a ratio of 36:1. At face value that sounds better doesn't it?</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Tips for running two marathons in short succession</h2>

<p>Seeing as I've read it all so you don't have to, here's my distillation of all the advice</p>


 * Rest the first week after marathon #1 - this is not a hard one to follow!
 * Look at how many weeks you have to go, and - bearing in mind the points below - loosely follow your plan for the equivalent number of final weeks before marathon #1
 * If marathon #2 is 4-5 weeks after the first, then count your first marathon as the last long training run
 * When you get started running again after #1, you can stick to easy paced running. You're "maintaining not training", so there's no need to push it
 * However, if you have done easy running for a couple of weeks and feel recovered, and you're not yet onto the taper of your plan, then prioritise intensity over distance - intervals, lactate threshold tempo runs, etc
 * Listen to your body not your mind - rest and recovery trumps running
 * There isn't a sweet spot where you have enough recovery and maintain the endurance levels from your original training - you're going to lose out on one or the other
 * If you're doing #2 four weeks after your first, be prepared to consider it as a run-for-fun rather than an opportunity for a PB, and go with what the day brings
 * If you're hoping to do #2 at full pelt then you're likely to need at least 8 to 12 weeks between the marathons (6 if you're really fit) - at which point given those extra weeks' work it may well feel much less like a two-for-one deal on your marathon training
 * Do one 16 to 20 mile run if you're up to it, but don't force it
 * A bit of foam rolling or a massage won't go amiss
 * Eat well, sleep well
 * Once more: listen to your body not your mind. When the mind pushes you to do more, or up the pace, remind yourself it's not a traditional training plan you're doing here

<h2 class="section-heading">Choosing the second marathon</h2>

<p>Then there are the logistic factors to consider. Given the risk that circumstances may intervene, for #2 I recommend looking for the following:</p>

 * Refunds in the case of injury
 * If there are no refunds, then find a marathon that doesn't sell out early and which leaves registration open right up until the last minute - so you don't have to book in advance
 * A marathon that sends the race packs out by post or allows pickup on the day,. This saves you having to arrive a day early (often by midday the way some of them are organised) - important if you want to minimise impact on family
 * One that's reasonably nearby, and accessible by train or bus so you don't have to drive afterwards. Who knows what you'll feel like?

<h2 class="section-heading">Putting it into practise</h2>

<p>For me, that turned out to be the <a href="https://www.bostonmarathon.co.uk/">Boston marathon UK</a>, also known as the Boston (not that one) marathon. It falls 5 weeks after the Thames Meander. And groin strain permitting, it's now 4 days away. So let's see how all that works out.</p>
