IDEA: some example grids? Easy to intense to taper? e.g. mine for 5 weeks; look at number of runs #1 and #2 -> 1 day. Or percentage of time. 3-4 runs a week for 16 weeks = ???. Ratio of ???:1 for the one that matters

Preparing for a marathon is a risky affair. You invest so much time in the training, and it all has to come together in one particular morning. If you're carrying a hamstring strain, feeling under the weather, having a busy period at work, being kept awake at night - too bad. I've been lucky not to have anything major get in the way, but both times I've run a marathon I had some problems that last week.

So what to do about it? Can you hedge it? 

Many articles, conflicting advice, you can find an opinion to suit your own needs. 

Read it so you don't have to on  successive marathons which is also body or mind related; 
add in my own tips about refunds, postage of the packs, injury attitude, when sell out and when have to travel. Important if youre minimising impact on family or others



* Rest the first week - this is not a hard one to follow!
* Look at how many weeks  you have to go, and - bearing in mind the points below - loosely follow your plan for the equivalent last weeks before marathon #1
* If marathon #2 is 4-5 weeks after the first, then count your first marathon as the last long training run
* When you get going, you can stick to easy paced running. You're maintaining not training, no need to push it
* However, if you have done easy running for 1 or 2 weeks and feel recovered, and you're not yet onto the taper of your plan, then prioritise intensity over distance - intervals, lactate threshold tempo runs etc
* Listen to your body not your mind - rest and recovery trumps running
* There isn't a sweet spot where you have enough recovery and maintain the endurance levels from your original training - you're going to lose out on one or the other
* If you're doing #2 4 weeks after your first, be prepared to consider it as a run-for-fun rather than an opportunity for a PB, and go with what the day brings
* If you're hoping to do #2 at full pelt then you're likely to need at least 8 to 12 weeks between the marathons (6 if you're really fit) - at which point given those extra weeks' work it may well feel much less like a two-for-one deal on your marathon training
* Do one 16 to 20 mile run if you're up to it, but don't force it
* A bit of foam rolling or a massage won't go amiss
* Eat well, sleep well
* Once more: listen to your body not your mind (link?). When the mind pushes you to do more, or up the pace, remind yourself it's not a traditional training plan you're doing here
