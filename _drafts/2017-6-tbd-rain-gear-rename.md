<p>In my last post I was waxing lyrical about the positive sides to going running in the rain. That's all well and good, I hear you say, but tell me about the gear!</p>

<p>Let's start with the importance of terminology. The experienced among you may have known this for years, but for me this was a revelation: while the difference in writing between "water resistant" and "waterproof" seems minor or subtle, the difference in reality is significant. And as with most running items, you can start out by making do but will soon heed the siren call of the upmarket options.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Water resistant</h2>

<p>I have one water resistant top, which is what I started out with: your entry-level Karrimor. A bargain at around £20 to £30 in your local stack-em-high-sell-em-low. How this one breaks down:</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check fa-green"></i>If its purpose is just to get you out of the door, under the illusion that you'll be sheltered from the rain, then it does that job</li> 
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check fa-green"></i>It will provide some protection from light rain over a relatively short period of time</li> 
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check fa-green"></i>It's cheap and a good place to start if you're just, er, testing the water</li> 
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-close fa-red"></i>But on a long run, or in heavy rain, it will get soaked through and cling to your body like a cheap shower curtain</li> 
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-close fa-red"></i>When you look to the left or right ahead of crossing a road you'll just see the inside of your hood unless you pull it back - it obscures your view</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-close fa-red"></i>As your average 'resistant' is not breathable either it'll get steamy inside.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, several drawbacks but let's be fair to it - it's still better than nothing at all, and the benefit of the psychological illusion that it will keep you dry is not to be discounted. It can be the differnect that gets you out the door.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Waterproof</h2>


<p>Good alternatives include the Montana one



A carefully designed hood shape, giving you good peripheral vision - meeting trail standards?
My Ron Hill is infinitely better than my Karrimor and got me out in dirty weather many more times than I would have done before, fulfilling its goal of keeping my marathon training going
But </p>

<ul  class="fa-ul">
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check fa-green"></i>This will both get you out of the door and keep you dry for a long time. Hurrah!</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check fa-green"></i>Once you're getting up to the waterproof price point it will be breathable too, don't settle for less</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check fa-green"></i>uh</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check fa-green"></i>It also has a clever trick whereby the pocket also serves as a pouch for packing the jacket. You reverse it, fold the garment in to it, then zip it up - one neat small package of Ronhill</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-close fa-red"></i>Be warned, talking from experience rather than from science I suspect it is difficult if not impossible to combine a garment which is fully waterproof with a garment that is fully breathable. On long runs you'll still get moisture inside, especially around the shoulders where the material touches you more</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-close fa-red"></i>uh</li>
</ul>

<p>One for work, one for home.</p>
