TODO: links; image - what about a composite of both? split screen style

<p>This year I completed my second marathon, the <a href="">Thames Meander</a>, almost a year to the day after the first in <a href="">Barcelona</a>. Looking back now and comparing the two, the training experience was similar but the race experience starkly different.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">The training</h2>

<p>To train for each marathon, I loosely followed one of the excellent <a href="">free Runkeeper race plans</a>. I say loosely, as try as I might I've never been able to keep up with either the number of runs per week or the number of miles per week. My approach is to make sure I always complete the long run of a given week, then do as much else as possible - but not worry too much when I skip some scheduled outings. I try get some interval runs in, and a half-marathon paced threshold run, and make do with that.</p>

<p>Then, of course, there is the unpredictability of outside events. The slings and arrows of training fortune. In this respect the two training periods were remarkably similar, confirming - if there were any doubt -  that you just have to be prepared to expect some ups and downs and interruptions. In both years, this aspect of the training was almost uncannily similar:</p>

 * In the second month of training, I had minor injuries to deal with - a hamstring strain the first year, an ankle sprain the second. In each case this meant about a week off, then gently easing back in (and a spot of <a href="">cross-training</a>)
 * I had the customary winter cold in January, losing another week
 * I was also ill in the week leading up to the marathon. The first time I think it was partly psychosomatic, the second time it was on the back of an exhausting week at work followed immediately by a weekend away, and a lack of opportunity to rest once it hit. It's sod's law at work, either way. The first time this meant dropping about 4 runs, the second time it was 10 days without a proper run before race day, save 15 minutes the day before. The silver lining here is that at least it's the taper by this point, and as my plans would say "the hay is in the barn" 


<h2 class="section-heading">The marathon</h2>


There were obvious differences in the type of race....

But here I'm more interested in the way I ran it and how I felt.

The second half feeling of strength - get what you put in. Rare so direct a relationship effort and reward. Reap what you sow in training. A level vs gcses and assembly comment - sharp intake of breath. But the risk too - all must line up for one day.

Input output, effort reward, reap what you sow

Other metaphor for this, visual? Filling the tank


Second marathon: 
build up, 10 days leading in no run apart from a 15 mins the day before
Fast start over-compensated, sowed the seeds of suffering
This time, from the half way point a struggle, not that boost of strength
Learn the hard way
reap what you sow in-race as well as from training.
