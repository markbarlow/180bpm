<p>For years I have kept to an unwritten rule of never joining a gym. Why? Firstly, if possible, I like to get outdoors for some fresh air if I'm going to do some exercise - I spend enough time indoors. Then there's the mix of non-refundable up front payments, minimum subscriptions and all the tales of usage tailing off a month after you sign up. I know some gyms have emerged from the dark ages and offer more customer-friendly payment options now, but I've still always kept away.</p>

<p>But then recently I had to break that rule, out of necessity. I was running over some leaves and turned my ankle on a hidden bit of tree branch. I'd torn ligaments on this ankle a few years back, and should have known better, but I carried on to finish my run as it didn't hurt much at first. The next day I was reminded of the folly of listening to the mind instead of the body. So I had to stop running for a while, but had a marathon coming up and felt that need to keep doing something. Reluctantly venturing into the alien environs of a gym was my punishment - desperate times, desperate measures.</p>
 
<p>This one was pay-as-you go so at least I wasn't making a commitment. As I sat on a cycle machine in a dingy basement there were pictures on the wall of a park, the one that is literally just over the road. I paid my dues and haven't been back since.</p>
