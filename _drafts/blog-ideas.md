Gym rule broken necessity

The rule why? minimum 1 year subscriptions and all the tales of wasted. Emerged from the dark ages but still kept away. This one was pay as you go so let myself off. But still as sat on a cycle machine there were pictures on the wall of  - literally - the road and park just outside.

This is one, as is the ‘read it so you don’t have to’ on  successive marathons which is also body or mind related; for that one add in my own tips about refunds, postage of the packs, injury attitude, when sell out and when have to travel. Importatnt if youre minimising impact on family or others
