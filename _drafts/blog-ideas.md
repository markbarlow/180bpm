2.  Helped me go further

Font awesome icons in a list (http://fontawesome.io/icons/) - change or remove color, blue red and green style so far in clean-blog.css:

</ul>



Images not used yet:
- blog-trees5 or trees6 with the head, depending on which goes better with text of given post
- blog-primrose3-1 is the best, others too much sun and alternative photos too faded/don't crop
- see other list for older ones like the DTS track ones not used yet

Images for inline, not for hero:
- blog-primrose2 did not crop but kept in case of inline use later (e.g. dawn run picture)
- blog-primrose1 may be good small, wasn't good enough qual for hero
- blog-primrose3-3 the sun obscures text when hero, nice pic though

The nostalgia of Ronhill
Vest
Trevis and the betting syndicate taking out a contender on the start line. Controlling the controllable limiting variables  - geography only answer if lppol played there

Trampolining tiring but soft
Water can give you a bruise the size of a football
This and arrival of sixth form
School gala
Scallies at kirkby
Rae and Davies

The gradual build up of ronhill - hat for winter training, shorts and socks for first marathon, two, three, four, jacket...

Price shock beyond budget but seed sown
The whole family Richmond second time
Stalking
A stitch apart
The packaging and now offfcut bags
Blog too
iffley road - apple comparison, packaging, present, technical gear makes you run faster;

shoe reviews


socks do they make a difference; shoes - nimbus 16 and DS trainer 21 ok for neutral;



# gym and recovery 



For years I have kept to an unwritten rule of never joining a gym. Why? Firstly, if possible, I like to get outdoors for some fresh air if I'm going to do some exercise - I spend enough time indoors. Then there's the mix of non-refundable up front payments, minimum subscriptions and all the tales of usage tailing off a month after you sign up. I know some gyms have emerged from the dark ages and offer more customer-friendly payment options now, but I've still always kept away. 

But then recently I had to break that rule, out of necessity. I was running over some leaves and turned my ankle on a hidden bit of tree branch. I'd torn ligaments on this ankle a few years back, and should have known better, but I carried on to finish my run as it didn't hurt much at first. The next day I was reminded of the folly of listening to the mind instead of the body. So I had to stop running for a while, but had a marathon coming up and felt that need to keep doing something. Reluctantly venturing into the alien environs of a gym was my punishment - desperate times, desperate measures.
 
This one was pay-as-you go so at least I wasn't making a commitment. As I sat on a cycle machine in a dingy basement there were pictures on the wall of a park, the one that is literally just over the road. I paid my dues and haven't been back since.

# pre-race chat
Blog - swim in your own lane. One upmanship. Always someone faster. Talent training attitude priorities time mix. Not just competitors though . The oh conversation before Maidenhead half - he didn't want to hear that. Neither did I.
