# the gear trio

the slippery slope
need vs want

The triumvirate of Iffley Asics Ronhill
The nostalgia of Ronhill
Vest
Trevis and the betting syndicate taking out a contender on the start line. Controlling the controllable limiting variables  - geography only answer if lppol played there 
Diving digression - limited pool of competitors. Lost fearless started thinking too much. Andrew 11 had a screw loose even before. Louganis. 2 weekends in sheffield at 16
Trampolining tiring but soft
Water can give you a bruise the size of a football
This and arrival of sixth form
School gala
Scallies at kirkby
Rae and Davies

The gradual build up of ronhill - hat for winter training, shorts and socks for first marathon, two, three, four, jacket...

The Iffley van
First encounter
Price shock beyond budget but seed sown
The whole family Richmond second time
Stalking
A stitch apart
The packaging and now offfcut bags
Blog too
iffley road - apple comparison, packaging, present, technical gear makes you run faster;


Asics
arte sana whatever....
shoe reviews


 socks do they make a difference; shoes - nimbus 16 and DS trainer 21 ok for neutral;



# gym and recovery 

Body or mind mistake
 
Gym rule broken necessity. Almost like a self-inflicted punishment for my folly.

The rule why? minimum 1 year subscriptions and all the tales of wasted. Emerged from the dark ages but still kept away. This one was pay as you go so let myself off. But still as sat on a cycle machine there were pictures on the wall of  - literally - the road and park just outside.
 
Desperate times desperate measures

There was another one here… aggravating an old injury? Hamstring example too from last time. And swimming tweet embed:

# doubling up

taking on two x half and possibly two x mara;
Read it so you don't have to on  successive marathons which is also body or mind related; 
add in my own tips about refunds, postage of the packs, injury attitude, when sell out and when have to travel. Important if youre minimising impact on family or others

​# running in rain
Blog - the rewards of running in the rain. Let's not pretend it's easy getting out of the house. Excuses come more readily. Old injuries ache. Especially in winter. Any old minor niggle will suddently act like it's an old scar, sensitive to the changes in moisture. But when do : the solidarity omerta everyone says hello in city where often don't that makes a difference. Fewer people. Fewer dogs and long leads.
Achievement sense. Once get going get Coccooned and spurs on for speed.

Discussed with a colleague who runs, told me once he gets out he sometimes lifts his arms to the skies shouting "Is that all you've got?!". A touch of the runner's high there, I suspect.

# pre-race chat
Blog - swim in your own lane. One upmanship. Always someone faster. Talent training attitude priorities time mix. Not just competitors though . The oh conversation before Maidenhead half - he didn't want to hear that. Neither did I.



# marathon get what you put in, unusually direct
Blog - marathon reflections. The second half feeling of strength - get what you put in. Rare so direct a relationship effort and reward. A level vs gcses and assembly comment - sharp intake of breath. But the risk too - all must line up for one day.

Input output, effort reward, reap what you sow

Other metaphor for this, visual? Filling the tank



# segments
parkland walk, in two parts and the history as site of landspeed record (after drinks, 1 in morning, at time of Blair Witch and feeling suggestible). Talking Bluebird, not Bolt. This photo of parkland walk is great https://www.flickr.com/photos/barryj/3502677676/
Liverpool prom
Malaga docks and beach - I love a seaside one
Swansea also
Hyde park loop 3 park loop


# up and down

injury and illness in training
