Inline image code (no tabs or else it gets treated as MarkDown) - 800w good for landscape to fill:

Quotes:
<blockquote> is all you need, maybe with <br>- Author Name</blockquote>


Bullet:

Numbered list - no space needed for this type:
1.  Not as tired or achey after runs
2.  Helped me go further

Font awesome icons in a list (http://fontawesome.io/icons/) - change or remove color, blue red and green style so far in clean-blog.css:
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check fa-green"></i>Stuff</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-close fa-red"></i>
</ul>



Images not used yet:
- blog-trees5 or trees6 with the head, depending on which goes better with text of given post
- blog-primrose3-1 is the best, others too much sun and alternative photos too faded/don't crop
- see other list for older ones like the DTS track ones not used yet

Images for inline, not for hero:
- blog-primrose2 did not crop but kept in case of inline use later (e.g. dawn run picture)
- blog-primrose1 may be good small, wasn't good enough qual for hero
- blog-primrose3-3 the sun obscures text when hero, nice pic though

need vs want

The triumvirate of Iffley Asics Ronhill
The nostalgia of Ronhill
Vest
Trevis and the betting syndicate taking out a contender on the start line. Controlling the controllable limiting variables  - geography only answer if lppol played there 
Diving digression - limited pool of competitors. Lost fearless started thinking too much. Andrew 11 had a screw loose even before. Louganis. 2 weekends in sheffield at 16
Trampolining tiring but soft
Water can give you a bruise the size of a football
This and arrival of sixth form
School gala
Scallies at kirkby
Rae and Davies

The gradual build up of ronhill - hat for winter training, shorts and socks for first marathon, two, three, four, jacket...

The Iffley van
First encounter
Price shock beyond budget but seed sown
The whole family Richmond second time
Stalking
A stitch apart
The packaging and now offfcut bags
Blog too
iffley road - apple comparison, packaging, present, technical gear makes you run faster;

shoe reviews


socks do they make a difference; shoes - nimbus 16 and DS trainer 21 ok for neutral;



# nimbus 16 adieu


Farewell and adieu to you fair Nimbus trainees
Viking burial

The asics Nimbus 16 were my first pair of 'proper' running shoes. 
Liked them so much I bought the company. Well I'm not quite at that level of wealth so for me it was a case of I liked them so much I bought two

500 miles debunked. I was naturally suspicious that such a round number could only be the work of marketing departments. If it were 477 miles, or 618 miles, I might have bought it for a bit longer.
This fine pair have done, to my reckoning, at least 1,000 miles and more likely closer to 1,500. They did my first ever half marathon, and most of my lunchtime runs for two and a half years. 
Yes, they're ugly, but this is a good case of not judging a book by its cover. I have become quite attached to them.


* Sorry, I couldn't resist - to make it up to any sea shanty lovers, here's the legendary Robert Shaw as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrpmv_zOa0k">Quint, singing the real lyrics</a> 



# pre-race chat
Blog - swim in your own lane. One upmanship. Always someone faster. Talent training attitude priorities time mix. Not just competitors though . The oh conversation before Maidenhead half - he didn't want to hear that. Neither did I.
