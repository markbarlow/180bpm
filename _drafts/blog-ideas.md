Inline image code (no tabs or else it gets treated as MarkDown) - 800w good for landscape to fill, anthing from 500 to 700h works for portrait:
<img class="img-responsive" src="/img/XXXX.jpg" alt="XXX">
<span class="caption text-muted">XXX</span>


H2:
<h2 class="section-heading">The training</h2>

Quotes:
<blockquote> is all you need, maybe with <br>- Author Name</blockquote>


Bullet:
 * Note the space before the asterisk

Numbered list - no space needed for this type:
1.  Not as tired or achey after runs
2.  Helped me go further

Font awesome icons in a list (http://fontawesome.io/icons/) - change or remove color, blue red and green style so far in clean-blog.css:
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check fa-green"></i>Stuff</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-close fa-red"></i>
</ul>



Images not used yet:
- blog-trees5 or trees6 with the head, depending on which goes better with text of given post
- blog-primrose3-1 is the best, others too much sun and alternative photos too faded/don't crop
- see other list for older ones like the DTS track ones not used yet

Images for inline, not for hero:
- blog-primrose2 did not crop but kept in case of inline use later (e.g. dawn run picture)
- blog-primrose1 may be good small, wasn't good enough qual for hero
- blog-primrose3-3 the sun obscures text when hero, nice pic though

# switching half to full training

the ratchet

when in the long slow slog of marathon, dream of shorter faster paced runs
when in the pain of a faster paced run or intevral, dream of more relaxed longer runs
But by the end of one programme you're about ready for the other



# the gear trio

the slippery slope
need vs want

The triumvirate of Iffley Asics Ronhill
The nostalgia of Ronhill
Vest
Trevis and the betting syndicate taking out a contender on the start line. Controlling the controllable limiting variables  - geography only answer if lppol played there 
Diving digression - limited pool of competitors. Lost fearless started thinking too much. Andrew 11 had a screw loose even before. Louganis. 2 weekends in sheffield at 16
Trampolining tiring but soft
Water can give you a bruise the size of a football
This and arrival of sixth form
School gala
Scallies at kirkby
Rae and Davies

The gradual build up of ronhill - hat for winter training, shorts and socks for first marathon, two, three, four, jacket...

The Iffley van
First encounter
Price shock beyond budget but seed sown
The whole family Richmond second time
Stalking
A stitch apart
The packaging and now offfcut bags
Blog too
iffley road - apple comparison, packaging, present, technical gear makes you run faster;


Asics
arte sana whatever....
shoe reviews


socks do they make a difference; shoes - nimbus 16 and DS trainer 21 ok for neutral;


# pre-race chat
Blog - swim in your own lane. One upmanship. Always someone faster. Talent training attitude priorities time mix. Not just competitors though . The oh conversation before Maidenhead half - he didn't want to hear that. Neither did I.



# segments
parkland walk, in two parts and the history as site of landspeed record (after drinks, 1 in morning, at time of Blair Witch and feeling suggestible). Talking Bluebird, not Bolt. This photo of parkland walk is great https://www.flickr.com/photos/barryj/3502677676/
Liverpool prom
Malaga docks and beach - I love a seaside one
Swansea also
Hyde park loop 3 park loop
Barcelona shore sun is rising (notes on phone)



# more gear - the fitbelt

Compare entry-level Karrimor
Doesn't stay on the hip, but doesn't bounce
6 energy gels, 2 in the pouch plus flapjacks
small card/money pocket
