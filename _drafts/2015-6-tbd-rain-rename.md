<p>Let's not pretend it's easy getting out of the house when it's raining. Excuses come more readily. Old injuries ache, especially in winter. A minor niggle will suddenly act like it's a gnarly old scar, sensitive to the change in moisture. But when you drag yourself out, and perservere through those first 5 minutes? The rewards of running in the rain are all yours.</p>

<p>There are fewer people about in the parks and on the pavements. Fewer dogs too, which means fewer long leads waiting to trip you. And amongst the runners out there there is a certain unspoken solidarity, a kind of omerta reflected in knowing nods and smiles. You're much more likely to be acknowledged by your fellow rain-bearers, and if you're in a city where runners often don't say hello then that makes all the difference.</p>

<p>And a kilometre in, a mile in, you get nicely coccooned. Your body warms up, and you get into a rhythm which seems smoother than normal. As you glide through the wet, you start to think you may actually be enjoying the rain itself. And when you turn for home, you can access a little extra kick, spurred on for speed as - despite your appreciation for the experience - it's also time to get in and get dry. With a special sense of achievement.</p>

<p>I recently discussed this with a colleague, who told me that once he gets out in the wet he becomes compelled to lift his arms up to the skies shouting "Is that all you've got?!". A touch of the runner's high there, I suspect, but what a great response.</p>



<p>That's all well and good , I hear you say, but tell me about the gear!</p>



The experienced among you may have known this for years, but for me this was a revelation: while the difference in words between "water resistant" and "waterproof" is subtle, the difference in what you get is significant. And as with most running items, you can start out by making do but will soon heed the siren call of the upmarket options.

<h2 class="section-heading">Water resistant</h2>

<p>The case for the defence: your entry-level Karrimor. A bargain at around £20 to £30 in your local stack-em-high-sell-em-low. How this one breaks down:</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check fa-green"></i>I started with a week off from running, just slipping one swim in to loosen the limbs</li>

</ul>

Purpose is just to get you out of the door, under the illusion that you'll be sheltered from the rain. Will provide some protection from light rain over relatively short period of time. But on a long run or in heavy rain it will get soaked through and cling to your body like a cheap shower curtain. The hood is also likely to obscure your view, and as your average 'resistant' is not breathable either it'll get steamy inside. Still marginally better than nothing at all, for the benefit of the psychological illusion - which is not to be discounted.

Waterproof

<h2 class="section-heading">Waterproof</h2>


Good alternatives include the Montana one

This will get you out of the door and keep you dry. Hurrah!
Once you're getting up to the waterproof price point it will be breathable too, don't settle for less
My Ron Hill is infinitely better than my Karrimor and got me out in dirty weather many more times than I would have done before, fulfilling its goal of keeping my marathon training going
But be warned, talking from experience rather than from science I think it is difficult to combine a garment which is fully waterproof with a garment that is fully breathable. On long runs you'll still get moisture inside, especially around the shoulders where the material touches you more




One for work, one for home.
