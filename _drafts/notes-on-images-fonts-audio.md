    1900 x 448 is the panel size.


     jjvico65 like:
     7 (solo shoe, better than 4) - centering is good for mobile too; in use on homepage
     6 (the herd) - good for blog maybe as represents many? in use for Credits
     9b (two shoes) decent but not centred for mobile - definitely use though goes with 7 very well; in use on music apps page
     4 (alternate solo shoe, currently in contact.html unused page), decent contrast especially if turn off the centering in the style sheet.
     1 (ticker couple without sufficient contrast for white text) - maybe for music artwork?
     8 (colourful ticker only) ok for subsidiary page / success page after got the picture of running but not as good as 1 which has feet too

     blog-runner2.png is a beauty, dark with light patches

     DTS1,2,3 all tried - DTS 3 is the winner for mobile centering reasons. DTS 2 is a spare option for any track related pages

     OK:
     jjvico65-5 (crowd legs barca) is ok but not as impactful as previous.
     Maidenhead (currently in post.html) ok but not as sharp, could be for a blog post style one
